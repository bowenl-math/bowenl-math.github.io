## About Me

Hello, I'm Bowen Liu, a PhD student in Yau Mathematical Sciences Center of Tsinghua University from Sept 2022, under the supervision of [Chenglong Yu](https://chenglongyu.github.io/). Also under the supervision of Mao Sheng from 2025. My research interests focus on vector bundles and Higgs bundles, such as non-abelian Hodge theory, stability condition, classifications and so on.

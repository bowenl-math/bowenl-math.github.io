### About me
Hello, I'm Bowen Liu, just a lover of mathmatics(smile). I am quite interested in exploring relations between things seem to be unrelated, especially in aspects of topology and geometry, with an algebraic approach. 


### Seminars

* (2022Summer, last updated 2022.10.13) Here is the draft of [lecture note](notes/2022Summer/note_for_atiyah's_CA.pdf) I typed for a seminar about communicative algebra.
* (2022Fall) Here are the lecture notes of talks I gave, in a seminar about Bott-tu's gtm82, which is organized by chenglong yu,
   - (Last updated 2022.11.13)[Čech cohomology](notes/2022Fall/Cech_cohomology.pdf)
   - (Last updated 2022.12.6)[Spectral sequence and its application](notes/2022Fall/Spectral_sequence.pdf)


### Course notes

#### 2022Spring

Here are some notes I typed during my study in enhanced program of BICMR in Peking University. 
* (Done)[Representation theory](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Representation_theory.pdf), lectured by Emanuel Scheidegger. Attention: There are still too many mistakes, typos and lack of logic. Maybe one day in future I will make it better, when I do need representation theory. 
* (Last updated 2022.7.17)[Hodge theory and complex algebraic geometry](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Hodge_theory_and_Complex_Algebraic_Geometry.pdf), lectured by Qizheng Yin.
* (Done)[Riemann surface](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/Riemann_surface.pdf), lectured by Xiaobo Liu.
* (Done)[Homology theory](notes/notes for enhanced program of BICMR/homology.pdf), lectured by Huabing Ge.


#### 2022Fall
* (Last updated 2022.12.6)[Riemannian geometry](notes/2022Fall/Riemannian_geo.pdf), lectured by Xiaokui Yang, I also added some related materials.


### TA

* (2022Fall, last updated 2022.12.6)Part solutions to homework of [Abstract algebra](notes/2022Fall/Sol_to_abstract_algebra.pdf)
* (2022Fall, last updated 2022.12.6)Lecture notes of [Algebra1-H](notes/2022Fall/Algebra1-H.pdf)

### Welcome to my homepage!
Hello, I'm Bowen Liu, a PhD student in Yau Mathematical Sciences Center of Tsinghua University from Sept 2022, under the supervision of [Chenglong Yu](https://chenglongyu.github.io/). My research interests focus on the non-abelian Hodge theory over characteristic zero and positive characteristic. Also, I'm interested in the stability of Higgs bundles and related topics.

My email is liubw22 [at] mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, and my workstation is S103 at C740 of Shuangqing Complex Building A. Please contact me if you find any mistake in my notes, and all comments are welcomed.

2024/1/13)

* [Symmetric space](notes/personal notes/symmetric_space.pdf). Notes I typed about symmetric space, and the main reference is the [textbook](https://books.google.com.hk/books/about/Differential_Geometry_Lie_Groups_and_Sym.html?id=DWGvsa6bcuMC&redir_esc=y) written by Sigurdur Helgason.

* [Complex geometry I](notes/personal notes/Complex_geometry_I/Complex_geometry_I.pdf) (Draft version). Lecture notes about complex differential geometry. The initial draft of this note is taken in spring 2022. in the course about Hodge theory taught by [Qizheng Yin](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~qizheng/#), and that’s my first time to learn this beautiful theory. Later in Spring 2023 I added more useful techniques and advanced topics (such as Schwarz computations, Calabi-Yau theorem and so on) I learnt in the course “advanced topics in complex geometry” given by Xiaokui Yang. I also added some other materials from classical books to make this note self-contained.

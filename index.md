![Bowen Liu](/img/photo.jpg)

Hello, I'm Bowen Liu, a PhD student in Yau Mathematical Sciences Center of Tsinghua University from Sept 2022, under the supervision of [Chenglong Yu](https://chenglongyu.github.io/). Also under the supervision of Mao Sheng from 2025. 

My research interests focus on vector bundles and Higgs bundles, such as non-abelian Hodge theory, stability condition, classifications and so on. Recently I'm studying bundles over abelian varieties.

My email is liubw22 [at] mails [dot] tsinghua [dot] edu [dot] cn, and you can find me at S103 in C740 of Shuangqing Complex Building A. 

Please contact me by email or let's have coffee at Shuangqing if you find any mistake in my notes. All comments are welcomed.

#### Learning Notes
* [Algebraic geometry](notes/2023Fall/algebraic_geometry.pdf). Notes I typed when I learned algebraic geometry from a course taught by Lei Fu, Fall 2023. (Last updated 2024/1/13)

* [Symmetric space](notes/personal notes/symmetric_space.pdf). Notes I typed about symmetric space, and the main reference is the [textbook](https://books.google.com.hk/books/about/Differential_Geometry_Lie_Groups_and_Sym.html?id=DWGvsa6bcuMC&redir_esc=y) written by Sigurdur Helgason. (Last updated 2023/09/12)

* [Complex geometry I](notes/2023Spring/Complex_geometry_I.pdf) (Draft version). Lecture notes about complex differential geometry. The initial draft of this note is taken in spring 2022 in the course about Hodge theory taught by [Qizheng Yin](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~qizheng/#), and that's my first time to learn this beautiful theory. Later in Spring 2023 I added more useful techniques and advanced topics (such as Schwarz computations, Calabi-Yau theorem and so on) I learnt in the course "advanced topics in complex geometry" given by Xiaokui Yang. I also added some other materials from classical books to make this note self-contained.

* [Partial differential equation](notes/2022Fall/pde.pdf), Notes I typed when I learned about PDE, and it mainly followed the [textbook](https://books.google.com.hk/books/about/Partial_Differential_Equations.html?id=Xnu0o_EJrCQC&redir_esc=y) written by Evans, Fall 2022.

* [Riemannian geometry](notes/2022Fall/Riemannian_geometry.pdf). Notes I typed when I learned about Riemannian geometry from a course taught by Xiaokui Yang in 2022Fall, and from this course I learnt quite a lot, Fall 2022.
